# React Resume
Replicated latex resume in React classes served with node and bundled with webpack.

To get started:

1. Install
  ```
  npm install
  ```

2. Build
  ```
  npm run build
  ```

3. Start
  ```
  npm start
  ```

After modifying the react classes to match your resume rerun the build step and then refresh [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

Once finished, it is time to get it out there for others to see! I used [shipit-deploy](https://github.com/shipitjs/shipit-deploy) to handle getting it to my digital ocean box.
